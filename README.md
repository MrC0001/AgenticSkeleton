# AgenticSkeleton

A simple Flask-based AI agent skeleton with both mock responses and Azure OpenAI integration.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/MrC0001/AgenticSkeleton.git
cd AgenticSkeleton

# Set up environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac OR .venv\Scripts\activate for Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env

# Start the server
python -m agentic_skeleton

# In another terminal, test the API
python -m agentic_skeleton.tests.test_api
```

## Configuration

By default, the application runs in mock mode which requires no API keys. To switch to Azure OpenAI:

1. Edit your `.env` file:
   ```
   # Change this to false for Azure mode
   MOCK_RESPONSES=true
   
   # Add your Azure OpenAI credentials
   AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your-key-here
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint-here
   ```

2. Make sure the `openai` dependency is installed:
   ```
   pip install openai
   ```

## Usage

### Mock Mode (Default)

By default, the application runs in mock mode, which doesn't require any Azure credentials.

```bash
# Ensure MOCK_RESPONSES=true in .env file
python -m agentic_skeleton
```

### Azure OpenAI Mode

To use with Azure OpenAI:

1. Set `MOCK_RESPONSES=false` in your `.env` file
2. Add your Azure OpenAI credentials:
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`
   - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
3. Run the application

## Domain Specialization

The system is capable of recognizing and adapting to different domains like:

- AI/Machine Learning
- Healthcare Technology
- Cloud Computing
- Data Analysis
- Development
- Writing Tasks

Each domain has specialized templates and responses that ensure relevant information is included in the generated content.

## Simplified Version (Primer)

The project includes a simplified version in the `agentic_skeleton/misc/` directory:

- `simple_primer.py`: A streamlined version of the main application
- `simple_primer_test.py`: A test client for the simplified app

To run the simplified version:

```bash
# Start the server
python -m agentic_skeleton.misc.simple_primer

# In another terminal, test the API
python -m agentic_skeleton.misc.simple_primer_test
```

Example output from the simple primer test:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment if not already activated
source .venv/bin/activate

# Make the demo script executable
chmod +x demo.sh

# Run the demo

### Test Output Formatting Features

All tests now include rich output formatting with:

- ✅ Colorized test results with pass/fail indicators
- 🟢 Green checkmarks for passed tests and 🔴 red X's for failed tests
- 📋 Detailed test plans and results shown in an organized format
- 🔍 Sample results with preview of content for quick verification
- 📊 Complete test summary with statistics

  - Blue: Test section headers
  - Green: Success messages and section labels
  - Cyan: Test outputs and detected values
  - Yellow: Expected values and important information
  - Red: Error messages and failures

### Cross-Mode Testing

The test suite supports both Mock mode and Azure mode:

- In Mock mode: All tests run without external dependencies
- In Azure mode: Azure-specific tests verify proper integration with Azure OpenAI services

Switch between modes by changing the `MOCK_RESPONSES` environment variable in your `.env` file.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required for Azure Mode |
|----------|-------------|---------|:----------------------:|
| `MOCK_RESPONSES` | Use mock responses instead of Azure | `true` | ✓ |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` | Azure OpenAI API key | N/A | ✓ |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI endpoint URL | N/A | ✓ |
| `AZURE_API_VERSION` | Azure OpenAI API version | `2023-05-15` | ✓ |
| `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT` | Azure OpenAI model deployment name | `gpt-4` | ✓ |
| `PORT` | Server port | `8000` | |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) | `INFO` | |
| `MAX_TOKENS` | Maximum tokens for Azure OpenAI responses | `1000` | |
| `TEMPERATURE` | Temperature for response generation | `0.7` | |

### Environment Setup Examples

For Mock mode (default):
```bash
MOCK_RESPONSES=true
PORT=8000
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

For Azure mode:
```bash
MOCK_RESPONSES=false
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your-api-key-here
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_API_VERSION=2023-05-15
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4
PORT=8000
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## Dependencies

The project requires the following key dependencies:

- **Flask**: Web framework for the API server
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **pytest**: For running tests
- **requests**: HTTP client for API calls
- **termcolor**: For colored terminal output
- **openai**: For Azure OpenAI integration (required for Azure mode)

Install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For development environments, additional tools are recommended:
```bash
pip install black flake8 isort pytest-cov
```

## Development

### Adding New Domain Knowledge

To extend the system with new domain specializations:

1. Edit `agentic_skeleton/core/mock/constants/domain_knowledge.py`:

```python
DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE = {
    # ... existing domains ...
    
    "new_domain_name": {
        "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"],
        "preferred_category": "write",  # or another category
        "guidance": "Specific guidance for this domain...",
        "subtasks": {
            "data": ["data-related", "terms", "for", "this", "domain"],
            "analysis": ["analysis-related", "terms", "for", "this", "domain"],
            # Add other subtask types specific to this domain
        }
    }
}
```

2. Add corresponding mock responses in `agentic_skeleton/core/mock/constants/mock_responses.py`:

```python
MOCK_RESPONSES = {
    # ... existing responses ...
    
    "new_domain_specific": [
        "Domain-specific response template for {topic}...",
        "Another domain-specific response about {topic}...",
    ]
}
```

### Adding New Response Templates

To add new response templates:

1. Add new entries to `agentic_skeleton/core/mock/constants/mock_responses.py`
2. Update domain knowledge in `agentic_skeleton/core/mock/constants/domain_knowledge.py` if needed

Example:
```python
# In mock_responses.py
MOCK_RESPONSES["data-science"].append(
    "[MOCK] Data analysis of {topic} shows three significant trends: first, the increasing adoption of..."
)
```

### Adding New Test Cases

To add new test cases:

1. For unit tests: Add new test methods to `test_unit.py` or `test_azure_unit.py`
2. For integration tests: Add new test methods to `test_integration.py` or `test_azure_integration.py`

Example of adding a new test case:

```python
def test_new_feature(self):
    """Test a new feature of the API"""
    # Setup test data
    test_data = {"request": "Test the new feature"}
    
    # Make request
    response = self.app.post('/run-agent', json=test_data)
    
    # Assert expectations
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
    data = json.loads(response.data)
    self.assertIn("plan", data)
    self.assertIn("results", data)
    
    # Add rich output formatting
    print(f"\n{colored('Testing new feature...', 'blue')}")
    print(f"\n{colored('Response:', 'green')}")
    print(f"  Plan steps: {len(data['plan'])}")
    print(f"  Results: {len(data['results'])}")
    
    # Additional assertions specific to this test case
    # ...
```

### Code Style and Formatting

Maintain consistent code style following these guidelines:

- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting: `black agentic_skeleton/`
- Sort imports with [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/): `isort agentic_skeleton/`
- Validate code with [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/): `flake8 agentic_skeleton/`
- Maintain test coverage with pytest-cov: `pytest --cov=agentic_skeleton`

### Continuous Integration

When contributing, ensure all tests pass in both Mock and Azure modes:

```bash
# Test in Mock mode
export MOCK_RESPONSES=true
python -m pytest

# Test in Azure mode (if you have Azure credentials)
export MOCK_RESPONSES=false
export AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your-key
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
python -m pytest agentic_skeleton/tests/test_azure_unit.py
python -m pytest agentic_skeleton/tests/test_azure_integration.py
```
